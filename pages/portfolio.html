				<h1>I am Nethender</h1>
				<p>I am a faceless content creator and musician who does not shy away from new ideas, learning from others, or experimentation. I even made this website by scratch learning HTML and CSS to do so, as an example. With a passion in creating online videos, music, and livestreams to entertain those who are looking to enliven their day, I have learned many things and gained experience in areas such as: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>How to edit to keep viewer retention</li>
					<li>How to appeal to an algorithm</li>
					<li>What ideas work for reaching a certain audience</li>
					<li>How to be both a live entertainer and keep the audience engaged</li>
					<li>How to effectively troubleshoot software issues</li>
				<p>All of these elements are crucial in growing an online brand/presence and can be applied to nearly anything!</p>
				</ul>

					<h2>The Nethender PK Project</h2>
					<p>With what started as a side project and snowballed into something much greater, Nethender PK is a channel where I show the world what is possible in the space of wheeled sports and parkour, expanding upon what ideas already exist and inventing unique techniques I personally developed.
						<br>
						<br>
					Here I experiment with the combination of different disciplines that primarily involve merging scooter tricks with Heely tricks, which is a wheeled shoe company that has previously sponsored me. I also work on improving and developing unique ways to use the camera to show the most action I can while making smooth and seamless edits to the music in the video. This has lead to an overall improvement to my simple yet effective editing style.
						<br>
						<br>
					Sound is just as important in these videos as the video itself, so I always take care to make sure the audience can hear the sound of wheels on pavement as much as they can the music. This substantially adds to the satisfactory of viewing these videos.</p>

					<h2>The Main Nethender Channel</h2>
					<p>In the main Nethender channel I create and plan to further expand into the concept of combining highly edited videogame videos and the creation of original music to enhance entertainment value. In addition to this, the content I create here works to allow more opportunities for creative story telling and comedic effects through the use of music.
						<br>
						<br>
					This supplys the channel with a unique and rich base concept that will help grow the channel over time. While the channel is currently in its infancy, here are examples from my reddit of what I have created as a proof of concept for what can be done with this idea.</p>

					<p>I also have experience making gameplay videos edited specifically to keep the attention of the viewer and to make the video as engaging as possable, which is seen in the example below:</p>

									<p>I have over six years of experience digitally creating various types of music in a wide range of genres ranging anywhere from lofi and chill music to hard hitting dubstep and electronic music.

									I have also been comissioned for my music work and have contributed to projects friends of mine have worked on in order to give their videos or games the feeling they are going for.
